## Building Magic (Hack Smarter Labs)

### Scope and Objective

Objective: As a penetration tester on the Hack Smarter Red Team, your objective is to achieve a full compromise of the Active Directory environment.

Initial Access: A prior enumeration phase has yielded a leaked database containing user credentials (usernames and hashed passwords). This information will serve as your starting point for gaining initial access to the network.

Execution: Your task is to leverage the compromised credentials to escalate privileges, move laterally through the Active Directory, and ultimately achieve a complete compromise of the domain.

**Note to user:** To access the target machine, you must add the following entries to your /etc/hosts file:
    
    `buildingmagic.local`
    `dc01.buildingmagic.local`
